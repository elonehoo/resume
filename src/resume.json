  "about":"My name is Elone Hoo, a programmer who likes open source. I really like to bring the ideas in my head into reality, into entities that everyone can see.<br /><br />I'm also an open source enthusiast and maintainer. I love the way open source enables collaboration and knowledge sharing, and I'm excited to see what I do finally feed back to the community and industry.<br /><br />In addition to programming, I also enjoy video games and reading books in areas I have absolutely no idea about.",
